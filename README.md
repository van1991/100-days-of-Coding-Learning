# 100-days-of-Coding-Learning

## Day 1: 13th November 2018

**Today's Work** : I have created a repo "Getting-Started-with-R-for-Analyst" to help begineers with getting started with R.

## Day 2: 24th March 2019

**Today's Work** : Covered the following topics

a. Understanding dataset using Descriptive Stats

b. Understanding dataset using Visualization - Univariant Analysis

**Link to the topic** : https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/applied-machine-learning/blob/master/Machine-Learning-R/README.md
Refer to **"Data Preparation in R"**

## Day 3: 25th March 2019

**Today's Work** : a bit of research on relation between the range of predicted probability of logistic regression and the % of 1s in the dataset and eventually concluded that it is due to imbalance of minority class in dataset.

Then learnt how to treat imbalanced dataset for classification modelling which led to improved predicted probability ranges.

**Disclaimer:** SMOTE & ROSE help in bring the predicted probabilities close to 0.9 but it need not neccessarily mean better model accuracy/results.

## Day 9: 13th May 2019

**Today's Work** : Review the top 3% rank Solution for FinHack LTFS-Data-Science-Finhack---Anlytics-Vidhya

**Description** : This has a detailed Python notebook. It contains good basic codes on Data Exploratory Analysis on Python. Refer to it for refering to syntax.

**My Performance** : I didn't do that well in this Hackathon.I got AUC = 0.59103 and Rank 1 got 0.6731.
