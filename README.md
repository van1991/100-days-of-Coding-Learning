# 100-days-of-Coding-Learning

## Day 1: 13th November 2018

**Today's Work** : I have created a repo "Getting-Started-with-R-for-Analyst" to help begineers with getting started with R.

## Day 2: 24th March 2019

**Today's Work** : Covered the following topics

a. Understanding dataset using Descriptive Stats

b. Understanding dataset using Visualization - Univariant Analysis

Refer to **"Data Preparation in R"**

## Day 3: 25th March 2019

**Today's Work** : a bit of research on relation between the range of predicted probability of logistic regression and the % of 1s in the dataset and eventually concluded that it is due to imbalance of minority class in dataset.

Then learnt how to treat imbalanced dataset for classification modelling which led to improved predicted probability ranges.

**Disclaimer:** SMOTE & ROSE help in bring the predicted probabilities close to 0.9 but it need not neccessarily mean better model accuracy/results.

The last link is related to creating ROC curves and KS-plots to evaluate the model performances
                        
## Day 5: 28th March 2019

**Today's Work** : Handling imbalanced dataset in supervised learning using family of SMOTE algorithm. After getting familiar with SMOTE, i read a bit more on other variations of SMOTE.
